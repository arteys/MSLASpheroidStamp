# MSLASpheroidStamp

# Introduction
WORK IN PROGRESS

But you can check 3d models 

# MSLASpheroidStamp overview

# Models list

Unfortunately the stl files are too big for github, so they are on [printables.com](https://www.printables.com/)

### Z-offset

Unfortunately the standards for culture plastic sizes are a joke. Especially for depth, so I attach stamp models with different z-offset to match to specific dishes/plates

### 6-plate/dish microwell production

#### Mold prodoctuion
##### The choice of silicone
This is the tricky part. Staying in the ideology of accessibility and DIY, I used the usual model two-component silicone available in the hobby store. Two-component platinum-based silicones definitely do not work - there is some kind of reaction between the silicone and the printed part and the silicone does not polymerize. Tin-based silicones remain, they generally work well. However, not all, I have met at least one that sticks to MSLA printed parts absolutely tightly and then it is impossible to separate the finished inserts. Accordingly, if someone decides to make such inserts, silicone will have to be selected empirically. I didn't use any chemical separators because I didn't want to add their remnants to the biological medium.

### 96-plate microwell production

#### Before starting work
Nothing is sterile by default or even intended to be. In the laminar box, it is highly recommended to treat the molds and stamps with 70% isopropyl or ethyl alcohol before the first use. You can use a spray bottle, but it is better to treat them by immersing them in a alcohol for a few minutes. 
I would not advise autoclaving, and moulds and stamps, in principle, should withstand such treatment, but without guarantees. 
It is most convenient to store it in the box of tips, this box can also be treated with alcohol and stored inside the laminar box while working. 

#### Tools and equipment

- Laminar flow cabinet
- Microwave or other way to melt the gel
- Stamps - 6 pieces
- Multichannel pipette (capable of dispensing 50 µl of liquid) - 1 piece
- Tub for multichannel pipette
- Tips for pipette
- 96-well plate  
- Agar/agarose solution with a concentration of about 1-3% mass per cent. The minimum volume required per plate is about 5 ml, but it is better to melt 10-20 so that the melted gel in the bath does not solidify so quickly.

#### Fabrication of microwells

Working with molten agar/agarose requires care and, more importantly, speed, so it is better to prepare everything within reach in advance
1. Set the pipette to 50 µl 
2.	Melt the agar/agarose solution, preferably bring it to a boil 
3.	In a laminar flow cabinet, pour the agarose into the tub for the multichannel pipette
4.	Use the pipette to transfer 50 µl into the two columns of the plate and immediately place a stamp in these columns. Make sure that the stamp is fully inserted (there is a tab on it centring it in the well, make sure it is inserted). It is necessary to do everything as quickly as possible, so that the gel does not freeze in the spouts of the dispenser
5.	Pour two more columns, set the stamp, repeat until all the stamps are installed 
6.	Wait for the gel to solidify (10-15 minutes, depending on agar/agarose and room temperature)
7.	Remove the stamps. This is the most critical step. It is most convenient to turn the plates with the short part towards yourself and remove the stamps with two hands from the sides. Gently rock the stamp back and forth before removal. If the gel concentration is optimal and the gel is fully cured, the stamp should come out clean and free of gel pieces and the microwells should remain intact inside the tablet. A few wells per plate usually come with bubbles, it's a matter of luck and it's hard to do anything about it. A video of the extraction process is shown below
8.	The microwells are ready for seeding of cells

#### Cell seeding

Before conducting a serious experiment, it is best to determine the optimal number of cells needed to form spheroids. They should not be too many or the extra cells in the well will form spheroids of uncontrolled size outside the microwells. The figure below shows spheroids formed from HeLa with different numbers of cells per cell. In this case about 1000-500 cells per microwell is optimal, when dense spheroids are formed after a day and there are practically no cells outside the cells. 

You will need standard equipment and supplies for working with cell cultures, as well as a microwell plate made in the previous step, and:
- Centrifuge or vortex with a plate rotor (optional)

1.  Detach the cells using the laboratory procedure.  
2.	Count the cells in suspension and dilute to the required number per microwell. One plate well can be filled with 50 - 100 µl of medium. 
3.	Transfer the cell suspension to the tub for the multichannel pipette
4.	Using the multi-channel pipette, transfer the cell suspension into the plate
5.	Either centrifuge at minimum speed to allow the cells to settle to the bottom of the microwells or hold the plates for 15-30 minutes to allow the cells to settle by gravity.
6.	Some cells are deposited between the cells or above or at the top of the plate cell where the stamp entered the agarose. To remove excess cells the plate should be tilted at 45 degrees and carefully remove the medium with excess cells with a multichannel pipette, pipetting several times.   
7.	50-100 µl of new medium can be poured in place of the removed medium 
8.	Place the plates in the incubator until the spheroids consolidate for 24 hours
